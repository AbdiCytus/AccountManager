## 📖 About The Project

**Accault** is a personal digital vault designed to solve the chaos of scattered passwords and forgotten accounts. Unlike traditional password managers, it focuses on the **relationships between your data**—tracking which email is linked to which service, organizing accounts into groups, and providing visual analytics of your digital life.

Built with the latest web technologies, it offers bank-grade security with a beautiful, responsive user interface.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔐 Bank-Grade Security:** All sensitive data (passwords) are encrypted using industry-standard AES algorithms before storage.
- **📊 Smart Analytics:** Visualize your account distribution with interactive charts and track your recent activities.
- **📂 Organized Vault:** Group your accounts (e.g., Work, Social, Gaming) and link them to specific Email Identities.
- **🌍 Multi-Language Support:** Fully localized in **English** and **Indonesian**, with persistent language preferences.
- **📥 Import & Export:** Full control over your data. Backup your vault to Excel or migrate data easily.
- **🌗 Dark Mode:** A stunning dark interface for late-night management, fully integrated with system preferences.
- **⚡ Modern UX:** Skeleton loading, glassmorphism effects, and smooth transitions powered by Framer Motion.
